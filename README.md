# ROCK_MINE_ACCURACY_PREDICTION
The project titled "ROCK MINE PREDICTION" aims to predict the accuracy score of hitting a submarine by a rock or a mine using different machine learning models. The problem statement involves utilizing various algorithms to determine the accuracy of classification between rocks (denoted as 'R') and mines (denoted as 'M') based on provided data.
